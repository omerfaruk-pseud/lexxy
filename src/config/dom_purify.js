// Lexxy's own DOMPurify instance, deliberately not the shared default export.
//
// dompurify's default export is a singleton, and both its config and its hooks
// are global to every consumer in the bundle. That makes configuring it from an
// editor's connectedCallback actively dangerous for the host app: DOMPurify
// treats a persistent config as final, so once setConfig() has run, every
// later `sanitize(html, config)` anywhere in the app silently ignores its own
// config argument. An app sanitizing untrusted HTML with, say,
// `{ ALLOW_DATA_ATTR: false }` would keep passing that option and stop getting
// it the moment a Lexxy editor connected — with no error and no visible change
// at the call site.
//
// Calling the default export with a window returns a fresh, independent
// instance. This one carries the hooks and config below; nothing we do here can
// reach the app's instance, and nothing it does can reach ours.
//
// Under Trusted Types, every DOMPurify instance tries to create a policy named
// `dompurify` on its first sanitize, and TT rejects a duplicate name — so the
// second instance on the page gets none. That matters, and not because it throws:
// DOMPurify hands its input to DOMParser.parseFromString, which is itself a TT
// sink, but `_initDocument` swallows that throw and the innerHTML throw from its
// createDocument fallback, and `sanitize` then returns "" for the body it never
// got. An unsigned instance silently drops all content, with nothing in the host's
// error tracker to say why — and which sanitizer goes silent depends on which one
// ran first.
//
// So we create our own, under our own name, and hand it to DOMPurify rather than
// letting it try. Lazily, because resolving it at import would fire a CSP
// violation report on every page load of an app that imports Lexxy and never
// renders an editor, and at most once, because TT throws on a duplicate name.
// Guarded too, because creating a policy the CSP hasn't allowlisted throws: if
// that happens we're back to no policy, which is exactly where this stood before.
// An app enforcing `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` should add `lexxy` to its
// `trusted-types` directive.
//
// What this does NOT do is make Lexxy work under enforced Trusted Types. It
// stops *our* sanitizer from taking the host's policy name and breaking the
// host's; it does nothing about Lexxy's own unwrapped sinks, and there are
// several. `parseHtml` in helpers/html_helper.js hands a plain string to
// DOMParser.parseFromString on the initial-value path, so the editor throws
// before it finishes connecting — verified in Chromium under
// `require-trusted-types-for 'script'`, with `lexxy` allowlisted and without.
// `createElement` in the same file is a second sink in it, writing its `content`
// argument through innerHTML for the two callers that pass one — the wrapped-table
// figure and the table tools' count. `highlightElement` in
// helpers/code_highlighting_helper.js writes Prism's output the same way, and both
// it and highlightCode are exported from src/index.js — so that one throws for a
// host app calling Lexxy's highlighting API directly, outside any editor. The
// `insertAdjacentHTML` in nodes/custom_action_text_attachment_node.js and the
// `innerHTML` writes across elements/ — the toolbar, the dropdowns, the node
// delete button — are in the same position. Making the editor usable under TT is a
// separate piece of work; this is a prerequisite for it, not the whole of it.
